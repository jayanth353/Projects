    Security researchers can report vulnerabilities found in indian websites, where this website acts as an medium between researchers and companies in which vulnerabilities were found. Researchers can approach our website to report vulnerabilities , we make sure their effort is useful by reporting the vulnerability to the respective company. And once we intimated the respective company that their website contains so and so vulnerability they will contact the researchers for further help about the vulnerability if needed by the company. 
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    The main motto of designing this website is to reduce the number of victims of cyber attacks and making india cyber safe. Many times cyber security researchers found vulnerabilities and faill to find the right mail or contact for contacting the company directly.We act as a medium and solve that problem, atleast this is the basic idea of the design behind this website.
 
    
    Many researchers find vulnerabilites in indian government website but don't know where and who to report. That's the main reason for creating this website. If you find a vulnerability make your best efforts to report the vulnerability by creating a clear steps of POC (Proof Of Concept) We forward that reports to respective website owners.
    We make our best effort to make india cyber safe.
